# AR-Linear-Regression-representation
created an AR application in Unity3D that can load a dataset derived from the numbers of patients which the hospital staff took care of during previous years, then make a prediction of how many patients they could expect to receive in future. During a meeting, this kind of application can be used in combination with image targets on paper documents, thus enhancing the interactivity of a report by making things easier to understand and visualize in peopleâ€™s minds for funding and planning purposes.
